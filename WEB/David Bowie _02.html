				the band was altogether
				Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
				And he was awful nice
				Really quite out of sight
			</p>
				<p>
				And he sang all night long
			</p>
				<p>
				Femme fatales emerged from shadows
				To watch this creature fair
				Boys stood upon their chairs
				To make their point of view
				I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
			</p>
				<p>
				Lady Stardust sang his songs
				Of darkness and dismay
			</p>
				<p>
				And he was alright, the band was altogether
				Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
				And he was awful nice
				Really quite paradise
				And he sang all night long
			</p>
				<p>
				Oh how I sighed
				When they asked if I knew his name
			</p>
				<p>
				And he was alright, the band was altogether
				Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
				And he was awful nice
				Really quite out of sight
				And he sang all night long
			</p>
					<p>
				Get some pussy now!
