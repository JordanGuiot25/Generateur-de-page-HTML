CT1:Let's Dance

CPS:Let's dance
CPS:Put on your red shoes
CPS:And dance the blues

CPS:Let's dance
CPS:To the song they're playin' on the radio

CPS:Let's sway
CPS:While color lights up your face
CPS:Let's sway
CPS:Sway through the crowd to an empty space

CPS:If you say run, I'll run with you
CPS:If you say hide, we'll hide
CPS:Because my love for you
CPS:Would break my heart in two
CPS:If you should fall into my arms
CPS:And tremble like a flower

CPS:Let's dance
CPS:Let's dance

CPS:Let's dance for fear your grace should fall
CPS:Let's dance for fear tonight is all

CPS:Let's sway
CPS:You could look into my eyes
CPS:Let's sway under the moonlight,
CPS:This serious moonlight

CPS:And if you say run, I'll run with you
CPS:And if you say hide, we'll hide
CPS:Because my love for you
CPS:Would break my heart in two
CPS:If you should fall
CPS:Into my arms
CPS:And tremble like a flower

CPS:Let's dance
CPS:Let's dance

CPS:Let's dance
CPS:Put on your red shoes
CPS:And dance the blues

CPS:Let's dance to the song they're playin' on the radio

CPS:Let's sway under the moonlight,
CPS:This serious moonlight
